# Code of Conduct for Algorithmia

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other status.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants' behavior and provides a framework for addressing unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or level of experience.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy toward other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at peggundev@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the repository, issue trackers, mailing lists, and social media channels associated with the project. It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Examples of acceptable and unacceptable behavior are non-exhaustive, and there may be other instances where a participant’s actions can be considered unacceptable. In the case of enforcement, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Warning** – A first-time offense will result in a warning from project maintainers. The warning will explain the unacceptable behavior and ask the participant to cease the behavior immediately.
2. **Temporary Suspension** – If the behavior persists after a warning, the participant will be temporarily suspended from contributing to the project for a defined period.
3. **Permanent Ban** – If the behavior continues, or if the situation is severe enough, the participant may be permanently banned from contributing to the project.
